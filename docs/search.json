    "text": "A meaningful life is one devoted to a purpose larger than one’s life. This ultimate goal should serve to guide our decisions at both easy and hard times. Although it may seem a difficult choice, I have simplified and rather considered simple, but extremely meaningful, rules of thumb to live and lead by. This rules consist of values I must always uphold, no matter the consequences. They should guide my decisions both in private and intimate settings as well as public and professional.\nThere are two main values. Under any circumstance I want to remain true to the values of Honesty and Curiosity. One may argue that either one of those is not exactly a virtue, but I’d argue in favor of considering them as such. Honesty entails a commitment to truth while Curiosity entails a commitment to, and appreciation of, the path to knowledge. In order not to be misled, I add the value of Compassion, so as to ensure that I will act in good faith and from a place of love. As life is uncertain and all paths forward intricate, I remain confident in that being responsible in upholding those values will get me somewhere I would want to be.\nThis has practical implications for my career path. A non exhaustive list would include: I’ll always foster open and transparent environments, no or very little politics; I’ll seek growth over comfort; I’ll seek autonomy; I’ll act in good faith and will demand the same in return, although it cannot be expected. That is as far as I can foresee. My values are firm.\nThis does not only mean that I will prefer some environment over other. There are strong consequences regarding my attitudes and daily choices. For instance, in order to deserve a job whose allure has captivated my attention I must put in honest and hard work towards becoming the kind of person that would be suited for the job. It must be the case that I will exhibit the kind of work ethic, in combination with the cunning and intelligence, to learn, create and network my way to the job.\nAs of the time of this writing (20-07-2023), I am an aspiring data scientist. Grosso modo, I’m on the right track but still lack the necessary skills to realistically compete for jobs.\nThe times ahead present challenging and joyful days. I’m entirely responsible to fill my days with energy and work, always uplifted by the fact that I am diligent in respecting this commitment that I make to myself. Consistently living up to these rules will imbue my life with meaning and purpose. Otherwise, I will suffer grave consequences. Beyond these rules I do have more specific, material goals that should never distract me from respecting and upholding my values. I must be patient. I must work hard. I must take pride in my good choices. I must not let ambition for quick gains blindfold me. I must aspire the good life."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A social scientist studies the mechanisms of human interactions. They attempt to bring about relevant ideas, classify and organize the knowledge concerning human society. Their explanations differ from those evolutionary and biological, in that they are concerned not only with raw observations of human habitats but with the collective imagination that permeate those habitats. The social scientist intends to understand the conceptualized representations of an individual within the society, as well to observe the macro-movements.\nThe importance of the social scientist stems from the need to comprehend the underlying reasons for our actions. As an economics student, I must, to a large extend, obey this logic. I am now in the middle of my quest to become a good social scientist, to be useful for society and to contribute to the body of works underpinning our understanding of social systems and of ourselves. I am still trying to form coherent ideas about myself and the world at a slow but relentless pace.\nThe idea to be in the social sciences once I had to go to college first began to appear to me as I was learning languages during my spare in high school. By the time I graduated high school, I could confidently hold a conversation in Spanish, English, French and German and slight less in Italian and Dutch. This was because over three years before I had committed myself to becoming a polyglot. In the process, I learned the different ways the languages differ from each other, their similarities and some specificities that unveil nuggets of culture and history.\nEuropean history became the source for my daily enthusiasm, particularly wars. I discussed with friends and teachers everything I read and watched on Napoleonic wars, World Wars and the Cold War. Thus, I began to notice how much I enjoyed, not only consuming contents in foreign languages, but the many aspects of human life that were involved in those events; a series of angles ranging from politics, economics, sociology to psychology.\nAt the same time, and with purpose to improve in the languages, I began to watch politicians speak. I fantasized about working at the UN, or at an NGO. So I approached people who could offer me the opportunity to participate in events, ‘modelos’, where I could hone debating skills. I had to talk to a Frenchman at the EU delegation. This is because I can’t remember a single time when my school was invited.\nSince the ‘modelo’ was for the European Union, I had to prepare for a debate around topics concerning the EU. As I researched information, I read a lot about economic crisis. This was 2013, and southern European countries were having a tough time. At the end of event, I was more than convinced that economics is my thing, over diplomacy or international relations. Probably, I became subconsciously attracted to the problems that economics deals with. While researching, I came across the terms interest rates, eurozone and debt crisis. My mind now turned its attention to questions such as: What is Banking and how it works? What determined the value of a currency vis-à-vis another, foreign currency?\nAt the time, I couldn’t fully articulate those questions, but the idea that economics was the field that I wanted to spend time studying, would remain unchanged.\nIt’s been two full semesters already of having enrolled in the economics program. There are great things about economics, and not so great things about economics. For instance, I admire my professor, who are people committing their life to do research on intriguing and interesting questions that concern the future of our institutions, our understanding of development and State building. Yet there have been times to dispel the misconceptions I had about economics. For example, I didn’t know about mathematical modeling and the uses of specific models. I thought that mathematics was only used in the form of Statistics to analyze data, but, as it turns out, it is used to formulate theory.\nAlthough I do not oppose the use of mathematics in economics, quite on the contrary, I support rigorous methods, some of the assumptions made to build up those models are very problematic. So, I finally understood why economics is much criticized. One set of these assumptions are the axioms of rationality. These axioms assure the modeler that an individual, or agent in economic jargon, always has an ordered set of preferences and that this individual, or agent, is going to act as if maximizing his or her pleasure exhausting his or her available resources. This is part of the neoclassical school of economics, and the ideas it advocated would sweep the world.\nAccording to Neoclassical models, the uninterrupted, disaggregated marketplace for the exchange of goods and services produce the most efficient outcome. This led to believe that any alternative other than the free market is to be ignored because of the ultimate superiority of the capitalist free market. This to me, and many others, sound more like an ideology than a logical conclusion from observed phenomena and reasoned theory.\nUnfortunately, economics has fallen prey to many ideologues, in the present as it has been throughout history. Even still, I love the field. Yet, as a social scientist I need to recognize the pitfalls of becoming enthralled by the conventional wisdom and stop asking questions. As a good social scientist, an aim that I pursue, I shall not let one representation of the world get in the way of my curiosity.\nIn accordance with my idealization of the good social scientist, I shall work toward rendering economics its due importance, by making it useful. This may require reconsidering methodologies, stepping back from preconceived ideas, challenging past assumptions and meeting with people. All that to further advance the process in understanding of human interaction and commerce and propose solutions to the most pressive problems that economics has promised to solve."

    "text": "Frankel, Vegh, and Vuletin (2011) proposed that the observed shifts from procyclical to countercyclical fiscal policies across a number of economies for the time period ranging from the 1960’s to 2000’s is due to superior or improved quality of the economy’s institutions. They achieved this by means of regression analysis. Indeed, their results show that, even after controlling for other factors that influence the conduct of fiscal policy, the quality of institutions remains a significant and economically important factor. They conclude that higher quality of institutions is associated with reduced procyclicality.\nThe conduct of fiscal policy matters for a reason. Procyclical fiscal policies, that is, either increased government purchases or reduced tax rates during periods of economic boom and its counterpart, decreased government purchases and tax raises during periods of recessions and burst, are said to exacerbate and prolong the business cycle. By contrast, countercyclical fiscal policy attenuates the business cycle.\nEmpirical exercises show that, over the past 5 decades, countries exhibiting countercyclical fiscal regimes are overwhelmingly developed and industrialized whereas those exhibiting procyclical are less developed. This fact appears in line with what is observed in other indicators used to gauge the maturity of fiscal policy such as the debt to GDP ratio, rankings by rating agencies and sovereign spreads. The interesting fact singled out by this paper consist of the exploration of changes in the cyclicality of the fiscal regime occurred in some countries.\nIt is shown that those countries who were once procyclical and are now countercyclical - those termed ‘recent graduates’ according to the authors - have had a major increase in the quality of their institutions. The quality of institutions was measured as an average of four indices from the International Country Risk Guide dataset. Panel data models were fitted with and without controls to soundly establish the relation between government outlays cyclicality and institutional quality. Results show that institutional quality is, indeed, associated with reduced procyclicality. Further, it is argued that improvements in institutional quality are responsible for the strength of the relationship. Throughout the time periods under study, institutional quality remains unaffected, except for the class of ‘recent graduates’ that experienced the largest increase."

Finally, the data rows were filtered for countries with a population over 1 million people and whose share of the economic world is over 0.1 percent.\n\n\nCode\n# load all packages in the tidyverse, plus additional packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\n# Read in and transform the Word Economic Outlook dataset\ndf &lt;- \n  read_tsv('../datasets/procyclicality/weo.txt') %&gt;%\n  select(-c('WEO Country Code', \n            'Units', 'Scale',\n            'Subject Descriptor', \n            'Subject Notes',\n            'Country/Series-specific Notes')) %&gt;%\n  filter(`WEO Subject Code` %in% c('NGDP_R', 'GGX', 'LP', 'PPPSH')) %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(cols = -c('WEO Subject Code', 'Country', 'ISO'), \n               names_to = 'Year') %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(id_cols = c('Country', 'ISO', 'Year'), \n              names_from = 'WEO Subject Code') %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    across(everything(), ~ifelse(. == 'n/a', NA, .)),\n    across(\n      c(Year, NGDP_R, PPPSH, LP, GGX), \n      ~as.numeric(gsub(',', '', .))\n      )\n    )\n\n# Further filter the dataset:\n# Only countries with population above 1 million and a share of word gross product\ndf &lt;-\n  df %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    Country %in% \n      (df %&gt;% \n         group_by(Country) %&gt;%\n         summarise(pop = last(LP), ppp = nth(PPPSH, 42)) %&gt;%\n         filter(pop &gt; 1, ppp &gt; 0.1) %&gt;%\n         pull(Country)),\n    Year &gt;= 1995,\n    Country!='Venezuela',\n    Country!='Uzbekistan'\n  ) %&gt;%\n  rename(NGDPR=NGDP_R) %&gt;%\n  select(-c(LP, PPPSH))\n\n\n\n\nFiscal Procyclicality Across The World\nPro- and counter-cyclicality are measured as the correlation between the cyclical components of two series: real GDP and government purchases. Since this measure consists of a correlation coefficient, it will be restricted to the range from -1 to 1. Positive values indicate a positive relation between changes in GDP and government purchases which describes the phenomenon of fiscal pro-cyclicality whereas negative relation indicates counter-cyclicality.\nSeveral manipulations must be applied to the data before delving into exploratory analysis. At the very intial stage, it is important to perform the following: take the logarithms of the series and calculate the cycle. Taking of logarithm of a series helps to tame excessive variability. The cycle was calculated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter as it was done in the original paper. Additionally, some of the countries in the final selection didn’t have all observations complete. Therefore, a procedure to backward fill these values was used whereby the a missing entry was filled with the next non-missing value.\n\n\nCode\n# Load up the library containing the routine for the Hodrick-Prescott filter\nlibrary(mFilter)\nlibrary(zoo)\n\n# Obtain the cyclical component of GDP and Government expenditures\ndf &lt;-\n  df %&gt;%\n  group_by(Country) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    across(c(NGDPR, GGX),\n           ~na.locf(., fromLast=TRUE)),\n    across(c(NGDPR, GGX),\n           ~hpfilter(log(.), freq=1)$cycle,\n           .names = '{col}_CYC'),\n  )\n\n\nFiscal regimes vary widely across the world. It is of interest to understand the reasons behind different policy choices, particularly on the assumption that the optimal policy consist of smoothing the cycle which is consistent with a counter-cyclical regime. Most countries in our sample are counter-cyclical, but this result is potentially biased because of the previous filter applied which left countries with a share in global GDP above the threshold of 0.1 percent. It is, however, noteworthy the wide range of values for the correlation between real GDP and government expenditures. Ecuador, at the rightmost position, is the most pro-cyclical country and the United Kingdom, at the leftmost position, is the most counter-cyclical. There is a big chunk of countries for which the relation is weak (0 ± .25) and may be described as acyclical.\nAs a general trend, most developed countries are found towards the left end of the distribution. This list includes countries such as Japan, UK, US, Norway, as well as some middle- to high-income countries. Towards the center and right end of the distribution the story is not as simple. The positions are shared by low, meddle and high-income countries and a disordered array. The commonalities that tie together pro-cyclical countries are interesting in that they may unveil the reasons that prevent a country to move to a counter-cyclical regime. One common feature shared by many of the countries that sit on right end of the distribution is that they are resource rich. Take the examples of Ecuador, Russia, Kuwait, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, etc.\nThe causes for fiscal pro-cyclicality reportedly found in the literature include two main strands. First, some countries have imperfect access to international credit markets. Second, political distortions affect the conduct of fiscal policy. Imperfect access to credit markets implies that these countries cannot access credit in times of recession and are forced to cut spending and cut taxes, thus reducing revenue. Political distortions occur when, given an increase in government revenue, politicians want a share of that revenue to support programs associated with their campaings and political parties.\nThe reason explored by Frankel et al (2011) is that these countries have, on average, institutions of less quality. They pointed to example of Chile which, although appears as more pro-cyclical in this replication, had managed to turn the tide and became counter-cyclical for the most part of the last two decades. This was achieved mainly thanks to a fiscal rule that was monitored by experts.\n\n\nCode\ndf %&gt;%\n  group_by(Country) %&gt;%\n  summarise(COR = cor(NGDPR_CYC, GGX_CYC)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Country, COR), y=COR)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', width=0.4, fill = '#213cb0') +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-1, 1, 0.25)) +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Across-Country Correlations Between Cyclical Components of GDP and Government Purchases',\n    subtitle = '',\n    x = '',\n    y = ''\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(size = .1, color = 'black')\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCountries once pro-cyclical can adhere to a counter-cyclical fiscal regime. The fact that this achievement is possible motivates the study for the underlying causes and/or mechanisms that enable this change. Chile is one example, but there are other as shown in the paper. The next figure highlights the trajectories of three countries: Ecuador, Guatemala, and the US. Ecuador exhibits a persistent pattern of high correlation between the expansion of the state and that of the economy. In contrast, the US presents the opposite pattern, although with more variability. Guatemala would stand as what the paper by Frankel et al (2011) would describe as a recent graduate. Its respective series for the rolling correlation went from looking like Ecuador’s to looking more like that of the US.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot rolling correlations\ndf %&gt;%\n  group_by(Country) %&gt;%\n  transmute(ROLCOR = rollapplyr(cbind(NGDPR_CYC, GGX_CYC), \n                             width=5,\n                             FUN=function(x) cor(x[, 1], x[, 2]),\n                             by.column=FALSE,\n                             fill=NA),\n            Year = Year) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, \n             y = ROLCOR, \n             group=Country,\n             color=Country,\n             alpha=Country)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlim(1999, 2022) +\n  ylim(-1., 1.) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('Ecuador'='#d6c720', 'Guatemala'='blue', 'United States'='red'), \n                     na.value = 'gray') +\n  scale_alpha_manual(values = c('Ecuador'=1, 'Guatemala'=1, 'United States'=1),\n                     na.value = 0.2) + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-.75, .75, 0.25)) +\n  labs(\n    title='Rolling Correlation Between The Cyclical Components of GDP and Government Purchases',\n    y = '',\n    x = 'Year'\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(size = .1, color = 'black')\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe countries in the panel exhibit wide differences in their paths. Frankel et al (2011) argue that the observed change has to do with improved quality of institutions. This hypothesis can be founded on a exploratory analysis of the relationship between institutional quality and fiscal pro-cyclicality before proceeding to formal statistical modeling.\n\n\nInstitutional Quality and Fiscal Procyclicality\nInstitutional Quality, as measured in Frankel et al (2011), consists of the average of four indicators included in the Political Risk section from the International Country Risk Guide dataset. A free tier from this paid dataset was used covering the years from 1996 to 2021. The values for 1997 and 1999 were missing and were interpolated via a cubic spline.\n\n\nCode\n# read in a subset of the Political Risk tier from the International Country Risk Guide dataset.\npoli &lt;- \n  read_tsv('../datasets/procyclicality/icrg.txt') %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols=-c('var', 'Year'), \n               names_to = 'ISO') %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(id_cols = c('Year', 'ISO'), \n              names_from = 'var',\n              values_from = 'value') %&gt;%\n  mutate(ISO = ifelse(ISO == 'ROM', 'ROU', ISO)) %&gt;%\n  rowwise() %&gt;%\n  transmute(ISO=ISO, Year=Year,\n            IQ = mean(c(RQ, VA, CC, GE)))\n\n# Merge new data to main dataframe\ndf &lt;-\n  df %&gt;%\n  left_join(poli, by = c('Year', 'ISO')) %&gt;%\n  mutate(IQ = na.spline(IQ)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Country) %&gt;%\n  mutate(ROLCOR = rollapplyr(cbind(NGDPR_CYC, GGX_CYC), \n                             width=5,\n                             FUN=function(x) cor(x[, 1], x[, 2]),\n                             by.column=FALSE,\n                             fill=NA)) %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\n# Write a function to plot time series\npltime &lt;- function(df_, country, variable) {\n  \n  llimit &lt;- ifelse(variable=='IQ', 0, -1)\n  colour &lt;- ifelse(variable=='IQ', '#e08f0b', '#1421de')\n  title &lt;- ifelse(variable=='IQ', \n                  'Institutional Quality Index', \n                  'Fiscal Procyclicality')\n  df_ %&gt;%\n    filter(Country==country) %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = !!sym(variable))) +\n    geom_line(color=colour) +\n    ylim(llimit, 1) +\n    labs(\n      title = title,\n      x = '',\n      y = ''\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      panel.grid.major.y = element_line(size=.1, color='black')\n    )\n}\n\n\nInstitutional quality and fiscal pro-cyclicality appear to be negatively correlated. From the inspection of the three following visualizations, it must be clearer why it is reasonable to hypothesize that it is likely these series are involved in a causal relationship. Ecuador, the most pro-cyclical country, exhibits the lowest institutional quality index among the three. The US exhibits a consistently high institutional quality index with exception of the most recent periods. Guatemala, our case of interest, presents an increase in institutional quality that closely coincides with the change from pro-cyclicality to counter-cyclicality. Note, please, that the increase in institutional quality comes a bit after the drop in fiscal pro-cyclicality began.\nIt should be stated, as it is in the paper, that we don’t know the direction of the causality as of yet. Namely, the causality may run from improved institutions to an improved fiscal regimes. Also, an improved fiscal regime may cause institutions to improve. It may be synergic as well. In this regard, Frankel et al (2011) also include the change in institutional quality from first to last period as the main explanatory variable and found that increases in institutional quality were associated with less pro-cyclicality.\n\n\nCode\n# Import library for a grid of charts\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\nplot_grid(\n  pltime(df, 'Ecuador', 'IQ'),\n  pltime(df, 'Ecuador', 'ROLCOR'),\n  nrow = 1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#\nplot_grid(\n  pltime(df, 'Guatemala', 'IQ'),\n  pltime(df, 'Guatemala', 'ROLCOR'),\n  nrow = 1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#\nplot_grid(\n  pltime(df, 'United States', 'IQ'),\n  pltime(df, 'United States', 'ROLCOR'),\n  nrow = 1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf %&gt;%\n  filter(Year %in% c(2018, 2019, 2020, 2021)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = IQ, y = ROLCOR, \n             group = Year, \n             color = as.factor(Year),\n             s=0.5)\n         ) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +\n  geom_smooth(linewidth=0.75,\n              span=0.9,\n              se=FALSE) +\n  guides(\n    color = guide_legend(title='Year')\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = 'LOWESS Model For Years 2018 to 2021',\n    y = 'Correlation between GDP and Govt.
