Hi there! I'm a young economist based in Quito, Ecuador. I received my Bachelors' degree from San Francisco de Quito university. Due to extensive experience during my Bachelors both from coursework and as a research assistant, I've become well versed in the application of statistics using highly demanded tools such as Python, R, and cloud technologies. At the moment, I'm actively looking for employment.

I was one the founding members of the [Data Hub Project](https://www.usfq.edu.ec/en/node/4116), a center aimed at collecting, tidying, and organizing existent and newly created databases, now part of the Computational Social Sciences lab of the San Francisco de Quito university. There I worked extensively on ETL pipelines that included the use of Python for extracting information, transforming it and uploading it to a remote repository in the cloud. I became acquainted with SQL via Google's Big Query. Also, I gained skills and experience with the scientific computing tack of the Python ecosystem.

Currently focused on building my personal presence online. My interests lie in statistical analysis mainly applied to economics and finance.
