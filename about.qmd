## Overview
Economist with Honors (Cum Laude) by the University San Francisco de Quito, Ecuador. During my undergraduate studies I explored a wide variety of advanced classes such as Complexity Economics - where I learned about network data analysis and agent-based modelling. I did a semester of international exchange in Chile (2021) where I farther delved into advanced topics such as economic history and undertook practical work replicating papers in macroeconomics. Additionally, I have experience chiefly as research assistant:

* Wrangling and prepping data for analysis with Pandas (Python)
* Exploratory data analysis via statistical summaries and data visualization (Python and R)
* NHST (Null Hypothesis Significance Testing - Python and R). In the frequentist tradition.

Currently working on acquiring the following skills:

* Expand my knowledge on Bayesian Statistics, Comparing Models, Multilevel Models. Reading the fascinating book "Statistical Rethinking" by Richard McElreath.
* Machine learning and deep learning
* Spatial and network data analysis
* Software Engineering.
